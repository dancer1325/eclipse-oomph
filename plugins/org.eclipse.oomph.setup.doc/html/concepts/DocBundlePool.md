* allows
  * | install many products & provision many target platforms, 
    * highly disk-space efficient
      * Reason: ðŸ§ ALL share a COMMON bundle pool ðŸ§ 
        * -> 1! .jar | disk / EACH installable unit
    * improve performance
      * Reason: ðŸ§ if an installable unit is | pool -> NEVER again needs to be downloaded ðŸ§ 
* uses
  * by Oomph's
    * `DocP2Task`
    * `DocTargletTask`
  * by ALL Eclipse's p2 technology
