 Oomph helps ensure that each developer works with the same uniformly-provisioned development environment
 and that each user has her personal tools and preferences uniformly available across all installations and workspaces.
 Note that Oomph can be installed into an existing IDE, i.e., one not installed by Oomph,
 via Oomph's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/updates/latest">update site</a>
 or via Oomph's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/updates/latest/org.eclipse.oomph.site.zip">site archive</a>.</p>
 
 <p>
 To understand how best to exploit Oomph in order to save time and spare aggravation,
 some basic concepts need to be well understood.
 Automation is achieved by specifying setup <a href="DocTask.html" title="Article in Oomph Setup Documentation">tasks</a> organized into <a href="DocScope.html" title="Article in Oomph Setup Documentation">scopes</a> stored in <a href="DocSetupResource.html" title="Article in Oomph Setup Documentation">resources</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 An important footnote is that Oomph makes heavy use of <a href="DocBundlePool.html" title="Article in Oomph Setup Documentation">bundle pooling</a>
 so it highly disk-space efficient to install many products and provision many target platforms
 because they can all share a common bundle pool such that for each installable unit, there is only on jar file on disk.
 Not only is this space efficient,
 it also dramatically improves installation and provisioning performance
 because once an installable unit is in the pool,
 it never again needs to be downloaded from the Internet.
