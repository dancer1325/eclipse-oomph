# Task Execution

* TODO:
<p>
 The <a href="DocTaskComposition.html" title="Article in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a> task list is prepared to <a href="DocTask.html.performance" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">perform</a> the specified tasks.
 This list is presented to the user on the setup wizard's <a href="../user/wizard/DocConfirmationPage.html" title="Article in Oomph Setup Documentation">progressPage page</a>.
 Initially,
 each task in the list is visited
 to determine if it needs to perform.
 That determination is generally influenced by the <a href="DocTask.html#DocTrigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">trigger</a>.
 Tasks that don't need to perform are logically removed from the list
 to induce the so called needed task list.
 The progressPage page allows the user to see either the full list or the needed task list.

 Each task remaining in the reduced list of needed tasks
 is then performed.
